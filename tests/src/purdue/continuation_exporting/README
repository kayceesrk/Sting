This directory contains test files for continuation exporting. Building and running the test programs is a bit more complex than the other examples. The steps are:
1. Be sure that you are on the root directory of the project.
2. Type "ant jar" to build the compiler and the runtime jars
3. Compile Client1.sj, Client2.sj, Client3.sj (the information on how to compile these is contained within the files).
4. Type "ant -f continuation.xml". This runs some instrumentation processing on the continuation classes (and some of the runtime classes).
5. Type "ant jar" again to include the instrumented runtime classes in the jars.
6. Run the servers (Client2 & Client3) and then run Client1 as described in the .sj files.
